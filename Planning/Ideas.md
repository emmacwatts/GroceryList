### What the code will do:

* Take in recipes
* Pick at random for correct number of meals as specified by user
* Print back grocery list by grocery section (produce, pantry, meats, dairy, bakery
* Can prompt to print ingredients with the recipe they're for
* can re-run and keep certain recipes only
* Make an ingredients type excel file and append this to the main pandas
* Add web element for input and output

### Associated project - the pantry

* Keeps track of pantry items and amounts
* Keeps track when it's used up as indicated by grocery list
* Flags things that need replacing soon
* Include shampoo and stuff?

### To continue

* 05/01 - setting up virtual enviornment into which grocerylist.py will go so that I can install packages
* 10/01 - need to reference the github files rather than the cloned files so that it's the same between different devices
